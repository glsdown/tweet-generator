# Tweet Generator

This was a project from 2018 where I explored how to generate text using trigrams, by exporting tweets from Twitter, using nltk to tokenize and identify trigrams, then to generate likely Tweets from the outcomes.

Due to his notoriety on Twitter at the time, it was targetted at Trump's tweets, but could be extended to use any alternative Twitter handle.

It uses the [tweepy library](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) to scrape tweets from Twitter.
